🎵 Project Overview: AI Playlist Generator
Goal:
Build a Python program that recommends songs based on user mood or text input, using basic NLP and song data analysis.

🟢 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
We want to set up a clean environment for data processing and machine learning.

1.1 Activate Your Conda Environment
Use the same Conda environment we set up earlier (e.g., auto_dj_env):

bash
Copy
Edit
conda activate auto_dj_env
If you want a fresh one for this project:

bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -n playlist_ai_env python=3.9
conda activate playlist_ai_env
1.2 Install Required Libraries
These will handle data, NLP, and recommendations:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
Library	Purpose
pandas	Handle song datasets (like Excel tables in Python)
numpy	Numerical operations
scikit-learn	Recommendation algorithms & data modeling
nltk	Natural Language Processing (analyzing mood input)
matplotlib/seaborn	Data visualization
🟢 Step 2: Get a Song Dataset
We need a dataset with song features like:

Song title
Artist
Mood/genre/energy (if available)
Danceability, tempo, or any numeric features
2.1 Where to Get Data:
✅ Recommended Options:
Kaggle:
Spotify Dataset - 600k+ Tracks (Has mood-like attributes like danceability, energy, valence)
Million Song Dataset (HDF5 format) – Advanced, but can be complex.
Spotify API – Live data, but requires API setup (optional for later).
2.2 Download the Dataset
Download the Kaggle dataset (CSV format is best).
Place it in your project folder (e.g., playlist_ai/).
Your folder structure will look like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
playlist_ai/
│
├── data/
│   └── spotify_tracks.csv
│
├── main.py           # Where we’ll build the playlist generator
└── requirements.txt  # Optional - Keep track of dependencies
🟢 Step 3: Load & Explore the Data
Before any AI, we need to understand our dataset.

Open main.py in your folder.
Load the CSV into pandas.
Print the first few rows and check the columns.
Identify useful columns, like:
name → Song title
artists → Artists
danceability, energy, valence → Good mood/feel indicators
popularity → Can help prioritize known songs
🟢 Step 4: Clean & Prepare the Data
Data is often messy.
We’ll remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and focus on key features like:

Song name
Artist
Energy/Danceability/Valence (mood indicators)
Popularity (optional)
Genre (if available)
You’ll filter down to these columns and drop any rows with missing data.

🟢 Step 5: Build a Mood-Based Filter
✅ Simplest Approach (To Start):
Group songs by energy & valence (happiness):

Mood	Energy Level	Valence Level (Happiness)
Chill	Low	Low
Happy	Medium/High	High
Hype	High	Medium/High
Sad	Low	Low/Medium
We’ll ask the user for a mood input (e.g., "chill", "happy"), and filter the dataset based on energy & valence ranges.

🟢 Step 6: Add Simple NLP (Optional)
You can expand this later to accept free-form mood input like:

“I’m feeling a bit down, but I want to stay motivated.”

We’d analyze the sentiment of this text using NLTK or TextBlob and map it to a mood like “chill” or “hype”.

But for now, we’ll keep it simple and just accept predefined moods like "chill", "happy", "hype", "sad".

🟢 Step 7: Recommend Songs
Once you’ve filtered by mood, recommend 5 random songs from that subset.

Later, you can prioritize by popularity or user preferences, but random is fine for now.
